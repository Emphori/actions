# GitHub Actions

This is a collection of GitHub Actions written to, hopefully, improve our
workflows here at Emphori. To use them, simply reference the action that you
wish to use with `Emphori/actions/<name>` in your workflow, and pass the
environment variables or arguments where noted in the documentation below.

They're not listed on the GitHub Actions Marketplace, so please drop a _star_,
or Tweet your successes if you find them useful! Happy hacking!
